Place the pan over a medium heat and cook, covered, for 6 to 8 mins or until the sugar is dissolved well and oranges have turned very soft and pulpy.Mix and take the mixture off the heat. Cool it completely and then add it to a blender and blend it to a fine puree. Set it aside for later use.Proceed to make the flourless cake, next. To do that, first set the oven to pre heat at 170 degrees C. Grease and line a 9 inch spring-form pan and set it aside.In a large mixing bowl, add sugar and eggs and using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat well on a high speed until the eggs are pale and fluffy. This will take approximately 5 to 6 minutes.Next, add in the baking powder and stir to combine.Gently fold in the measured out almond meal, hazelnut meal and orange puree. Do this gently, by folding it in with a spatula rather than thoroughly mixing it with a whisk or spoon, taking care not to deflate the egg and sugar mixture.Pour the batter in the lined cake pan and bake it in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes until the top looks set and gets a golden brown hue.If you feel the top is cooking too fast, place a sheet of aluminium foil over it to avoid burning.Bake it for another 25 minutes. As the baking continues, the sides of the cake will start leaving the pan and will shrink a bit.After about 40-50 minutes of baking, insert a skewer into the centre of the cake and if it comes out free of batter, the cake is done.Remove it from the oven and set it on a cooling rack to cool completely, while you prepare the cream cheese frosting.To prepare the frosting, beat together all the ingredients mentioned for frosting until soft and smooth.When the Orange cake has cooled completely, release it from the springform tin and place it on a cake plate or tray.Frost the cake as you wish by slathering the cream cheese topping on it. Then, place it in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving.You can garnish the Flourless Orange Cake with almond flakes, orange slices and mint leaves.Serve the Flourless Orange Cake\u00a0chilled or at room temperature.",

You store this liquid and use it in the vegetable stock or risotto.Once the beans are cooked, our next step is to spice it up to make the baked beans.Heat oil in a sauce pan on medium heat; add in the onions and garlic and give it a light saut\u00e9 until the onions are tender.
